# Age Comparison with Soccer Celebrities

This is a Python program that asks the user for their name and date of birth, and compares their age with some famous soccer players.

## Features

- The program uses the `datetime` module to calculate the number of days the user has been alive.
- The program defines a `MonthConverter` class that converts the user's input of a month name to a numerical value.
- The program defines a `User` class that stores the user's name, and a `soccerCeleb` class that stores the name and date of birth of a soccer player.
- The program creates a list of soccer players with their names and dates of birth, and compares the user's age with each player's age.
- The program prints the user's name, the number of days they have been alive, and the names of the soccer players who are older and younger than the user.
